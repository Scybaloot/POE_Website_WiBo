				Our plan for IR navigation was to put 10 IR LEDs in a ring around the charging station and two IR receivers on the robot. Depending on which IR receiver was seeing more IR light, the robot would either go left, right or straight until it drove over the station, engaging a mechanical stop that would cut off power to the Arduino.

				Unfortunately, we were not able to completely implement IR Navigation. Initial testing showed promise, but we now know that the tests were not robust enough to reveal some of the problems that we later ran into. We realized too late that the IR receivers we had purchased were not suited to our needs and would not give us the kind of information necessary for IR location sensing. We tried to replace the IR receivers by using two of the IR LEDs as photodiodes. This did not provide clean enough data, however, and in the end we were not able to tune the system to work successfully.
