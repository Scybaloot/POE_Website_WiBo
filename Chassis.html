			<p>This chassis and charging base were designed to be low cost and highly robust. The design maximized the amount of surface area available to mount the electronic components, and to accept a wide range of coil diameters. All the laser cut parts fit snuggly within each other, and are then secured using a light application of Gorilla Glue.</p>

			
			<p>The spring loaded coil holder can accept coils from 1” to 5.5” in diameter, as well as coils up to 2” tall.</p> 

			
			<p>The charging base  has an adjustable mounting plate for the wireless power transmitter to adjust the separation from the receiver coil. The IR LEDs mount to the bottom in conveniently cut holes, providing a ring of IR light.</p>

			
			<p>To minimize cost the wheels are also made from laser cut plywood, coated in wood glue to increase the traction.</p>

			
			<p>The chassis includes a rear guard mechanism that triggers a P-MOSFET transistor to disconnect the arduino from the battery pack during the charge phase, as well as serving as a mount point for the IR sensors. The placement of this guard plate provides further shielding from IR light as the body of the chassis acts as a hood for the IR transistors.The guard includes cut-outs for easy mounting of the push-button switch and the IR sensors.</p>


			<p>The Vigor precision motors were selected for the availability, as well as low cost. Similar motors can be purchased from Pololu for ~$6 a unit. The motors are mounted using four 1.5” long #4-40 screws and plain hex nuts.</p>

			
			<p>In keeping with the low cost design of the system, the chassis employs tank steering and requires only two wheels. A simple tail in the back helps to move the center of gravity behind the axis and keep the robot stable at all time.</p>
