                                        Inspiration For The Project
                                </div>

                                <p>Behind the Olin dorms is a parking lot called lot B, and spaces in this lot are heavily-coveted. The initial project idea that this came out of was to build a lot B tracker robot that could sense when spaces were empty and could report back to a text-messaging service or website.
                                </br> </br>
                                However, we realized that the scope of this project was much too large, and simply docking the robot would be a difficult thing to do in itself. We thought building a docking robot would be an interesting problem to address, so we aimed to solve this problem instead.</p>

                                        <li>The robot would be able to dock at the charging station from one meter away. </li>
                                        <li>Once docked, it would charge at 250 mW of power for USB charging at 12 mm range.</li>
                                        <li>The chassis would be cheap and easily reproducible.</li>
