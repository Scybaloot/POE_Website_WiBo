					The original plan for the wireless transceiver was to build it from scratch, experimenting with configurations to maximize efficiency. The in-house transceiver ultimately did not deliver an acceptable amount of power to a USB charger. As a back-up plan, a transceiver was purchased and used.

					<div>
					Power is transmitted from the charging station to the robot using wireless inductive transfer. When the transmitter coil is aligned and within working distance of the receiver coil, the system is inductively coupled. Power is transferred when the transmitter is given a square wave. The AC current inside the transmitter produces an oscillating magnetic field. This magnetic field travels through space, inducing AC current in the receiver coil.

					</div>

					<div>
					An H-bridge was used to produce the driving signal. The H-bridge received four timing signals, which were square waves identical in amplitude and frequency, each offset by 90 degrees in phase. In the development phase, these timing signals came from a function generator, whose two outputs could be adjusted so that  The LCR circuit powered by the power inverter was tuned so that the transmitter resonant frequency was matched to that of the receiver LCR circuit, in order to minimize losses.

					</div>

					<div>
					On the robot, a voltage is induced in the receiving coil because of the oscillating magnetic field from the transmitter coil. The receiving LCR circuit was also tuned to ensure that the resonant frequencies were matched. Because the output of the receiver coil is AC, the output is rectified and filtered into DC power, which is fed into a boost converter, and then a USB battery charger.

					In order to prevent the Arduino from trying to draw power from the batteries while they are being charged, we attached a button to the bottom of the robot and connected it to the gate of a p-channel MOSFET. The MOSFET is connected between the battery pack and the boost converter that powers the Arduino. When the robot docks, the button is pressed and a voltage is applied to the gate of the MOSFET, cutting off the connection between the batteries and the Arduino.
