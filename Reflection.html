                                        <div> There is an unpopular notion that the most successful PoE teams are those who fail the most miserably. None of us began this project with that mantra in mind, but as we reflect on the semester, we see the truth in that statement. Our team made a lot of mistakes, but they are all areas from which we learned a great deal.
                                        </div>

                                        <div>Our biggest failure was not communicating effectively. After having chosen a project, we split up into sub-teams and began working on various sub-systems: the chassis, the wireless charging unit, and the IR navigation system. Each sub-team went about development, each assuming the others were doing well. It was not until development of the wireless system began to lag behind that we began to seriously become concerned with the state of the project. At that point it was too late.

                                                We did not use class time as effectively as we could have. Some days, members of the team would show up very late, or not at all. Other days, we would come to class tell each other we were going to work on our subsystem, then separate to work on our subsystems. We did not ask as many questions as we should have.

                                        <div>
                                                Because we did not know exactly what was going on in other subteams and trusted that the work would get done in time, there was no critical analysis of the state of the project. One member of the team did not know how complicated the problems he was facing were, and other members of the team lost sight of the larger project goals, preferring to continue their approach, even when they should have changed it. If there was adequate communication between team members, we would have been able to criticize the work of our team mates and correct errors team members were running into.

                                                Team members attempted to communicate the progress of their work over email, but responses were delayed, and explanations very dense. Email communication about technical progress gave the impression of communication but was not an adequate substitute for in-person reports.

                                                In addition to not communicating the technical challenges well to each other, we faced difficulty communicating our more personal challenges. One team member would send intensely emotional emails to the rest of the team, and this made team members uncomfortable. As a team, we never discussed the emails, and not discussing them probably did not help address the problems.

                                        <div>
                                                We had deadlines for sub-components, but these deadlines were not stuck to. For example, the wireless charging component was supposed to be functional before fall break, but it was not, and we pushed the deadline back to the first few days after fall break, then the first weekend of fall break, and then the second weekend of fall break. Rather than push back deadlines, we should have adapted our approach to solving wireless charging and purchased commercial, off-the-shelf parts for wireless charging. This would have allowed much more time over break and after break for system integration. If we had a project manager making plans for deadlines not met and enforcing them, we could have compromised on smaller parts of the system and would have had a greater chance at achieving the larger goals of the project.

                                        <div>Despite our failure to deliver a complete system, this project was filled with learning, and each of us gained valuable experiences.

                                        <div>
                                         Colby learned the importance of reading data sheets and asking questions, and he became more comfortable debugging circuits. He also had the opportunity to build the team website from the HTML to the CSS and Javascript, and this has been a challenging and educational experience for him.

                                         On the less technical side, he learned the importance of having a project manager. The role of the project manager is to facilitate communication, resolve conflicts and work to make sure there are backups for when deadlines are not met and plans fail.

                                        <div>
                                         Jimmy enjoyed working on the in-house transceiver, as he got the broad exposure that he wanted, learning about inductor coil geometry, about how to maximize efficiency using impedances, about how to drive the coils and the various ways the desired signals can be generate.

                                        <div>
                                         For Caitlin, her learning was much more centered on the management and communication side, though she did considerable work with the wireless system and the IR navigation with Colby.

                                        <div>
                                         James struggled a lot to engage himself in the project, and for him this project was about learning to accept that not all projects are going to be engaging, and to do what is needed of him. In the end, James found interest in building a coil winder, and this challenge excited him, so he learned that even in projects where there is not initially something interesting work, he can find interesting and challenging work.
