There is an unpopular notion that the most successful PoE teams are those who fail the most miserably. Of course none of us began this project with that mantra in mind, but as we reflect on the semester, we see the truth in that statement. Our team made a lot of mistakes, but they are all areas from which we learned a great deal.<br/><br/>

Our goals for this project were ambitious. As a team of four people, we planned to implement and integrate several non-trivial systems â€“ the chassis, IR navigation, and wireless charging. The original plan of building our own wireless charging system from scratch was particularly bold, as it is still an area of active research, and we should have been more wary of failure than we were. In the end, we were able to create a chassis suited to the needs of wireless charging and an electrical system that could power the robot using a commercial wireless charging unit, but fell short of achieving our goal of autonomous IR navigation.<br/><br/> 

The root cause of our failure was not communicating effectively. After having chosen a project, we split up into sub-teams and began working on various sub-systems: the chassis, the wireless charging unit, and the IR navigation system. Each sub-team went about development, each assuming the others were doing well. It was not until development of the wireless system began to lag behind that we began to seriously become concerned with the state of the project. At that point it was too late. Although we pivoted away from building our own wireless charger in house, and began to focus on developing the IR navigation, we did not come together in time and our navigation system failed to work.<br/><br/>

 

This project was filled with learning, however, and each of us gained valuable experiences:
<br/><br/>
 

Colby learned how to read data sheets better, became more comfortable debugging circuits and code. He also learned the importance of asking for help earlier rather than later. He also had the opportunity to build the team website from the HTML to the CSS and Javascript, and this has been a challenging and educational experience for him. On the less technical side, he learned the importance of having a project manager. The role of the project manager is to facilitate communication, resolve conflicts and work to make sure there are backups for when deadlines are not met and plans fail.<br/><br/>

 

Jimmy engaged himself in the project by focusing on the in-house wireless power transceiver. Through this route, he sought to gain a broad exposure to electronics, and do a deep dive into wireless power design. He enjoyed learning about the various factors which influence power transfer efficiency, and gained some good intuition about how to approach power electronics in general. His cautionary tale: be wary when scoping project components which require working with many unknowns.<br/><br/>

 

For Caitlin, her learning was much more centered on the management and communication side, though she did considerable work with the wireless system and the IR navigation with Colby.<br/><br/>

 

James struggled a lot to engage himself in the project. Initially, the lack of a challenging mechanical engineering component made the project uninteresting to him. However, when he looked more into the project, he found a component that was interesting to him: building a coil winder. He produced a refined model of this in Solidworks and fabricated a chassis for the robot.
<br/><br/>

Overall, despite our failures, each member walked away with valuable lessons for the future. We are all a bit disappointed in not having built a complete working system, but we would not trade a working robot for the education we received.<br/>
