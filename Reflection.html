					<div> There is an unpopular notion that the most successful PoE teams are those who fail the most miserably. Of course none of us began this project with that mantra in mind, but as we reflect on the semester, we see the truth in that statement. Our team made a lot of mistakes, but they are all areas from which we learned a great deal. </div>

					<div>Our biggest failure was not communicating effectively. After having chosen a project, we split up into sub-teams and began working on various sub-systems: the chassis, the wireless charging unit, and the IR navigation system. Each sub-team went about development, each assuming the others were doing well. It was not until development of the wireless system began to lag behind that we began to seriously become concerned with the state of the project. At that point it was too late. Although we pivoted away from building our own wireless charger in house, and began to focus on developing the IR navigation, we did not come together in time and our navigation system failed to work. </div>

					<div>This project was filled with learning, however, and each of us gained valuable experiences. Colby learned how to read data sheets better, became more comfortable debugging circuits and code. Jimmy enjoyed working on the in-house transceiver, as he got the broad exposure that he wanted, learning about inductor coil geometry, about how to maximize efficiency using impedances, about how to drive the coils and the various ways the desired signals can be generate. For Caitlin, her learning was much more centered on the management and communication side, though she did considerable work with the wireless system and the IR navigation with Colby. James struggled a lot to engage himself in the project, and for him this project was about learning to accept that not all projects are going to be engaging, and to do what is needed of him. </div>

					<div>Overall, despite our failures, each member walked away with valuable lessons for the future. We are all a bit disappointed in not having built a working system, but we would not trade a working robot for the education we received. </div>
